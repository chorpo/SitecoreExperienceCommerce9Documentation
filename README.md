Sitecore Experience Commerce 9 Documentation for eReaders

Official Sitecore Experience Commerce 9 Documentation is in HTML and split into seperate files. This repository contains documentation for three guides which is suitable for eReaders. All HTML pages from official documentation have been merged together and all unneccesary page parts have been removed (left side menu, footer and so on). I have also added table of content.

Three guides included in this repository and converted for eReaders:
- SXA Storefront - Taken from https://doc.sitecore.net/sxa_storefront
- Commerce Connect Components - Taken from https://doc.sitecore.net/sitecore_commerce/commerce_connect_components
- Setting up Commerce Connect - Taken from https://doc.sitecore.net/sitecore_commerce/setting_up_commerce_connect

You can find in this repository 3 types of files under each documentation folder:

- PDF - for PC, laptop screens or for general purposes; works on any eReader
- mobi - for Amazon Kindle eReaders - Specifically formatted to Kindle Voyage but should be working without any problem on others like Paperwhite and Oasis
- ePUB - for Kobo, Pocketbook, B&N and other brands which support this format

More guidelines and other useful information about Sitecore can be found in my blog https://tothecore.sk
